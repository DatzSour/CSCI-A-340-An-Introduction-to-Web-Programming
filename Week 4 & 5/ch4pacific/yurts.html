		enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
		<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
		<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with sown quilt and gas-fired stove.
		Yor luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
		running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
		<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
		<dd>Most guests pack confortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
		weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
		sense of adventure.</dd>
